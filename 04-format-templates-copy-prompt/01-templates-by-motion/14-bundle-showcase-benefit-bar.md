# 14 — Bundle Showcase + Benefit Bar

🏷️ Sells the system, not the SKU. The open box is the hero. The benefit bar handles the "what's in it for me."

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)
- **needs_product_images:** true
- **reference_uploads:** brand-spec-card.png + visual-style-card.png + product image (bundle / multi-SKU)
- **top_safe_zone:** 270px (scaled for aspect)
- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Every image prompt MUST include: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo, do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

An open bundle/gift box as the hero, photographed slightly overhead, revealing multiple products nested inside. A horizontal benefit bar (5 segments) sits above the product. A lifestyle prop (hand, dumbbell, flower) enters from the foreground. Gradient background. Works for bundle SKUs, gift sets, routine kits, or any product sold as a system.

## Variation vectors

**Background gradient**: pink-to-hot-pink | brand pastel-to-saturated | deep brand primary solid | warm-to-cool diagonal

**Bundle packaging**: open gift box (default) | flat lay of SKUs | open drawer reveal | kit tray with cut-outs

**Product count**: 2 SKUs | 3 SKUs (default) | 4-5 SKUs (larger bundles)

**Benefit bar count**: 3 segments | 5 segments (default) | 4 segments

**Foreground prop**: hand + dumbbell (fitness) | fresh flowers (beauty) | coffee cup (morning) | water glass (wellness) | no prop (cleaner)

**Camera angle**: slight overhead (default) | straight-on | 45° three-quarter

## Format-specific rules

- **Benefit labels must be compact.** 1-3 words max per segment. "Morning Energy" works; "Supports morning energy levels" breaks the bar.
- **Parallel structure across labels.** All five follow the same grammatical shape — all noun phrases or all verb phrases, not mixed.
- **Bundle must be real.** Don't show 4 SKUs if the bundle only ships 3. Agent 4 and Agent 7 both flag fabricated contents.
- **Color variation across SKUs is visual.** If all products in the bundle are identical in color, the format fails — use a template where the single SKU is hero instead.
- **Prop must match audience.** Dumbbell for fitness, flowers for beauty, water for wellness. A mismatched prop tells the viewer this is stock.
