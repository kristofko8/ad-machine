## Copy template

```
[SUPERLATIVE HEADLINE]   - 3-6 words. Uppercase bold. Brand-color sans.
                           e.g., "THE WORLD'S HEALTHIEST CHOCOLATE" /
                                 "THE LAST MULTIVITAMIN YOU'LL NEED" /
                                 "PROTEIN. PERFECTED."

[CTA]                    - 2-4 words. In a white pill button.
                           e.g., "EXPLORE NOW" / "SHOP THE RANGE" / "TRY IT TODAY"

[STAT 1-3]               - Each is a number + short label. Bold dominant number.
                           e.g., "12G OF PROTEIN" / "≤2G OF SUGAR" / "≤3G OF NET CARBS"

No body copy. The product + stats do the argument.

## Image generation prompt

Below headline: white rounded-rectangle pill CTA button with [BRAND COLOR] uppercase bold text "[CTA]".

Center: the product (reproduced exactly from reference) in full packaging, angled slightly, hero-lit with soft studio lighting. Product fills the vertical center zone.

Surrounding the product: [SCATTERED ELEMENTS — broken chocolate pieces / cocoa powder dust / crumbs / ingredient pieces / powder puffs / sprinkled oats] arranged in an exploded radial pattern creating visual energy and texture on the background surface. Debris looks natural — not machine-placed.

## Variation vectors

**Background**: warm sand (default) | cream | soft brand-tint | off-white linen | pastel accent

**Debris theme**: ingredient pieces (default) | powder dust cloud | cross-section scatter | liquid splash | natural botanicals

**CTA placement**: under headline pill (default) | floating top-right badge | integrated into stat bar | none (stats only)

**Stat count**: 3 metrics (default) | 2 metrics | 4 metrics | single hero stat

**Product angle**: slight tilt (default) | straight-on front | 3/4 angle | laying flat with props

**Energy**: premium craft | clean clinical | abundant maximalist | minimal editorial

## Format-specific rules

- **Superlative must be defensible.** "THE WORLD'S HEALTHIEST" gets flagged by Agent 4 unless verifiable. Prefer category-bounded superlatives ("THE CLEANEST PROTEIN IN [CATEGORY]") or swap to a strong declarative.
- **Stats must come from the real product panel.** Inventing "12g protein" when it's 8g breaks trust and law.
- **Debris feels natural, not machine-placed.** Random scatter, varied sizes, real shadows.
- **Product is the hero.** If the debris overpowers the product, rebalance. The packaging must be the primary read.
- **Stat bar readable at thumb-scroll scale.** Numbers dominant, labels short and bold. If labels wrap, rewrite shorter.
