# 28 — Feature Arrow Callout / Product Annotation

🏷️ Product held by hand. Hand-drawn arrows point to 4 benefit callouts around it. Editorial feel with a promo banner at the bottom.

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)
- **needs_product_images:** true
- **reference_uploads:** brand-spec-card.png + visual-style-card.png + product image
- **top_safe_zone:** 270px (scaled for aspect)
- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Every image prompt MUST include: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo, do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

Italic serif headline at top, then a massive bold value prop ("ALL IN ONE"). Center: a hand holding the product with 4 curved arrows pointing to benefit callouts arranged around it. Bottom: full-width contrast banner with a promo/CTA. Works for products with multiple named benefits that need to be called out visually.

## Variation vectors

**Background**: warm cream (default) | light yellow textured | soft brand-tinted | off-white linen

**Hand position**: hand reaching from bottom (default) | hand from left side | hand from right side | hand from upper-right

**Arrow style**: hand-drawn curved (default) | slight squiggle | clean curved | bracket-pointer

**Callout count**: 3 callouts | 4 callouts (default) | 5 callouts | 6 callouts (max info density)

**Promo banner style**: full-width solid (default) | pill at bottom | ribbon wrap | bright burst badge

**Energy**: editorial and inviting | bold and promo-driven | elegant and elevated

## Format-specific rules

- **Hand must look natural, not prop-staged.** Product held loosely, fingers relaxed. Mannequin-style grips kill the format.
- **Arrows connect to real product features.** Each arrow originates from the specific visible element it's calling out (ingredient label, cap, texture).
- **Parallel structure across callouts.** All 4 follow the same pattern — don't mix "NO sugar" with "For your morning routine."
- **Promo banner must have a real offer.** "HUGE SALE" without a real campaign = lost trust. Only use when there's a real promotion.
- **Italic serif + bold sans combination carries the format.** Replacing both with the same font flattens it.
