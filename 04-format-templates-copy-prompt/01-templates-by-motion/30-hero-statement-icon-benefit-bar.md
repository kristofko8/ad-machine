# 30 — Hero Statement + Icon Benefit Bar

🏷️ Bold 2-3 word power statement. Lifestyle product shot in the middle. 3 icon+label benefits at the bottom. Scrolling social-proof ticker.

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)
- **needs_product_images:** false (product in lifestyle scene only)
- **reference_uploads:** brand-spec-card.png + visual-style-card.png + product image
- **top_safe_zone:** 270px (scaled for aspect)
- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Product visible in the lifestyle scene must be reproduced exactly per reference. The image prompt should say: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo (visible in the lifestyle scene), do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

Three-zone layout. Top 15%: massive 2-3 word power statement in a white banner ("APPETITE KILLER."). Middle 55%: lifestyle product shot (hand holding a capsule above a supplement jar). Bottom 25%: light brand-color zone with 3 icon+label benefits in columns. Very bottom: scrolling ticker bar with social proof. Works for weight-loss / performance / functional products where the claim needs bluntness.

```
[POWER STATEMENT]   - 1-3 words + a period. All caps, massive.
                      e.g., "APPETITE KILLER." / "INSTANT ENERGY." / "DEEP SLEEP."

[ICON + LABEL 1-3]  - Each 2-4 words next to a simple line-drawn icon.
                      e.g., "(crossed-out burger) CURB APPETITE"
                            "(lightning bolt) BURN CALORIES"
                            "(heart + body) LOSE WEIGHT"

[SOCIAL PROOF]      - Repeating ticker text.
                      e.g., "OVER 300K+ LIVES CHANGED" (repeating across the bar)

No CTA. Power statement + benefits + social proof ticker.

Create a hero statement + icon benefit bar ad for [BRAND NAME]'s [PRODUCT NAME]. [ASPECT RATIO — 1080x1080 / 1080x1350].

COMPOSITION:
One continuous image filling the entire frame, divided into three horizontal zones.

Top 15%: white banner overlay with massive bold [BRAND COLOR from spec card — dark purple / brand dark] uppercase sans-serif headline "[POWER STATEMENT]" with a period for punch.

Middle 55%: lifestyle product photo — [SCENE — a woman's hand holding a capsule above an open supplement jar on a clean surface / a person pouring product onto breakfast / product in natural use context]. Soft natural light. Product label and branding clearly visible (reproduced exactly per reference image).

Bottom 25%: [SOFT BRAND COLOR — lavender / light purple / pastel brand] background. Three evenly spaced icon-and-text benefit columns:

## Variation vectors

**Power statement style**: 1 word + period (e.g., "FUEL.") | 2 words + period (default) | 3 words + period

**Lifestyle action**: hand holding capsule above jar | pouring powder | applying topically | mid-swallow shot

**Icon style**: simple line-drawn in circles (default) | filled brand-color icons | flat emoji-style | minimal geometric

**Bottom zone color**: soft lavender / pastel | brand pastel | warm cream | off-white

**Ticker content**: social proof count (300K+ lives) | review count (10K+ 5-star) | press accolades | category rank

**Energy**: blunt and confident | clinical and direct | warm and reassuring

## Format-specific rules

- **Power statement must end with a period.** The period IS the format. "APPETITE KILLER" without the period reads as mid-sentence. With it, it's a verdict.
- **Icons must be consistent in style.** Don't mix line-drawn with filled; don't mix geometric with emoji-style.
- **Parallel structure for labels.** All 3 benefits in the same grammatical pattern (verb-object, verb-object, verb-object).
- **Social proof ticker must be truthful.** Fabricated numbers break trust and law.
- **Category compliance.** Weight-loss / supplement claims require legal review in most markets. Power statements like "APPETITE KILLER" may trigger health-claim rules.
