**Accent color**: neon green (default) | electric yellow | hot pink | bright orange

**Hand position**: gripping from above (default) | pulling from side | holding mid-air | two hands presenting

**Icon style**: line-art in circles (default) | filled accent-color icons | outlined geometric | emoji-style

**Energy**: Black Friday aggressive | everyday-promo confident | seasonal celebration | flash-sale urgent

## Format-specific rules

- **Period on power statement is mandatory.** Same rule as #30 — "FUPA KILLER" reads mid-sentence; "FUPA KILLER." is a verdict.
- **Discount must be real.** "40% OFF" without a live promo = false advertising. Only use when the campaign is actually running.
- **Category compliance.** Health / weight-loss / supplement power statements may violate ad-platform claim rules. Verify before shipping (Meta + TikTok enforce strictly).
- **Icons consistent in style.** Don't mix line-art with emoji-style. Pick one visual language.
- **Hand looks natural.** Gripping the product like a tool, not like a display. Realistic tension in fingers.
- **Accent color is loud on purpose.** Muting it for "brand safety" kills the sale energy — either commit or use #30 instead.
