# 16 — Curiosity Gap / Hook Quote Testimonial

🏷️ The bait-and-switch testimonial. Provocative headline forces the double-take. The reveal reframes it. Scroll-stop machine.

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)
- **needs_product_images:** true
- **reference_uploads:** brand-spec-card.png + visual-style-card.png + product image
- **top_safe_zone:** 270px (scaled for aspect)
- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Every image prompt MUST include: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo, do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

Mixed typography testimonial. A small italic setup line at the top. A massive provocative bait phrase in the middle ("FAKING IT WITH MY HUSBAND"). A smaller reveal line that reframes it ("since perimenopause — with [BRAND] I don't have to"). Bottom third: product + trust badge + star-count card. The double-take is the hook.

## Copy template

```
[SETUP LINE]       - 2-5 words. Italic serif or semi-bold small.
                     e.g., "I've been" / "For years" / "Nobody knew"

[BAIT PHRASE]      - 3-7 words across 1-2 lines. Huge all-caps heavy weight.
                     Sounds alarming, suggestive, or taboo on first read.
                     e.g., "FAKING IT / WITH MY HUSBAND"

[REVEAL]           - 6-15 words. Smaller sentence-case. Reframes the bait.
                     e.g., "since perimenopause — with [BRAND] I don't have to"

[ATTRIBUTION]      - "- First name + last initial"

[TRUST BADGE]      - Circular seal. e.g., "60 Day Guarantee" / "100% Money Back"

[REVIEW COUNT]     - e.g., "3,600+ 5-Star Reviews"

[DISCLAIMER]       - Optional small text. e.g., "Results may vary. No results guaranteed."

## Variation vectors

**Bait direction**: taboo/suggestive ("FAKING IT") | mock-confession ("LYING TO MY KIDS") | shocking claim ("I HATED THIS") that reveals positive | authority provocation ("MY DOCTOR WAS WRONG")

**Setup style**: italic serif | semi-bold sans | all-caps small | handwritten script

**Bait weight**: ultra-black all-caps (default) | bold italic | condensed bold all-caps

**Product side**: left bottom (default) | right bottom (mirrored) | centered below text

**Trust badge position**: next to product (default) | top right corner | integrated into review block

**Review count format**: "3,600+ 5-Star Reviews" | "Rated 4.9/5" | "Trusted by X customers"

## Format-specific rules

- **The reveal must reframe positively.** First read alarms the viewer. Second read makes them nod. If the reveal doesn't land, the format is doing harm.
- **Bait must not be cruel or exploit protected categories.** No fat-shaming, no medical-gaslighting, no offensive stereotypes. Cleverness, not cruelty.
- **Truth in the claim.** Agent 4 and Agent 7 both flag if the reveal promises something the brand can't deliver. The bait may be dramatic but the reveal must be honest.
- **Typography hierarchy is the whole trick.** If the setup, bait, and reveal are all the same size, the format collapses. Weight contrast is non-negotiable.
- **Disclaimer is often legally required** for categories like supplements, skincare, weight-related products, finance. Check category rules before shipping.
