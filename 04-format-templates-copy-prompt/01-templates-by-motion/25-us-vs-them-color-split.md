🏷️ Bold saturated color split comparison. Dynamic action product photography. Comic-style VS burst. Meme energy.

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)

- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Every image prompt MUST include: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo, do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

Sibling of #07 but with saturated color block split and dynamic product photography (chocolate dripping, liquid pouring). Left: vibrant brand color with your product in action + 4 strengths with green checks. Right: pale/cream background with a generic competitor + 4 weaknesses with red Xs. Comic-style VS burst in the center. Meme-format energy that could go viral on social.

Create an us-vs-them color split ad for [BRAND NAME]'s [PRODUCT NAME]. [ASPECT RATIO — 1080x1080 / 1080x1350].

COMPOSITION:
One continuous image filling the entire frame, divided vertically into two equal halves.

Left half: [PRIMARY BRAND COLOR from spec card — vibrant teal / saturated brand] background. The product (reproduced exactly from reference) photographed with dynamic energy — [ACTION DETAIL — chocolate dripping / liquid pouring / melt shot / splash motion] to convey indulgence and vitality.

Top-left: [BRAND] logo in bold white caps.
Below the product: vertical stack of 4 benefits, each with a green filled circle checkmark emoji: "[STRENGTH 1]", "[STRENGTH 2]", "[STRENGTH 3]", "[STRENGTH 4]" in bold white uppercase.

Right half: [CONTRAST COLOR — pale cream / muted beige / soft neutral] background. A generic unbranded competitor product [DESCRIPTION — crumpled foil-wrapped chocolate bar / generic plain packaging], shot in flat unflattering lighting.

Top-right: "[COMPETITOR CATEGORY]" header in dark text.
Below the competitor product: vertical stack of 4 weaknesses, each with a red filled circle X emoji: "[WEAKNESS 1]", "[WEAKNESS 2]", "[WEAKNESS 3]", "[WEAKNESS 4]" in bold dark uppercase.

Center divider: a comic-style "VS" burst graphic in [ACCENT COLOR — coral / red / brand accent] spanning the split line.

[If CTA]: "[CTA]" at bottom per brand spec card.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Per uploaded brand spec card. Both sides use bold all-caps for parallel rhythm. Logo + VS burst in loud accent styling.

SAFE ZONES:
Top [TOP SAFE ZONE]px and bottom [BOTTOM SAFE ZONE]px clear.

COLOR AND TREATMENT:
Saturated brand color on left, muted neutral on right. Product on left shot with action/energy lighting. Competitor on right shot flat. Center burst in contrast color that pops against both halves.

MOOD:
Loud, confident, meme-worthy. "The difference is obvious."

## Variation vectors

**Left color**: vibrant teal | brand primary saturated | hot pink | deep brand color

**Right color**: pale cream (default) | muted beige | flat light gray | pale warm neutral

**Action detail**: chocolate drip | liquid pour | splash motion | crumble burst | powder scatter

**VS burst style**: comic burst (default) | circular red badge | lightning bolt graphic | diagonal slash with VS text

**Check / X style**: emoji-style filled circles (default) | drawn checkmarks and Xs | minimalist dots (harder read)

**Strength/weakness framing**: nutrition stats (default) | ingredient callouts | process claims | ethical claims

## Format-specific rules

- **Never name real competitors.** Use category labels. Naming specific competitors creates legal risk.
- **Weaknesses must be true of the category.** Agent 4 and Agent 7 flag fabricated claims.
- **Parallel stats.** Every strength has a direct numeric opposite weakness. "12G PROTEIN" pairs with "2G PROTEIN," not with "Boring."
- **Action photography on the left is non-negotiable.** If your product looks flat, this format fails. Use drip, pour, splash, or motion.
- **Comic VS burst is the brand moment.** Don't replace with minimal text. The burst signals meme-format playfulness.
- **Agent 4 flags for luxury / clinical brands.** Meme energy works for D2C / community / playful brands.
