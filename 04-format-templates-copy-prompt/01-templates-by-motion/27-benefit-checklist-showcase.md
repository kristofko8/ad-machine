# 27 — Benefit Checklist Showcase (Split Product + Info)

🏷️ Split composition. Product reveal on the left (overhead). Review count + benefit checklist + CTA on the right.

## Metadata

- **aspect_ratio:** 1:1 default (1080x1080) | 4:5 alt (1080x1350)
- **needs_product_images:** true
- **reference_uploads:** brand-spec-card.png + visual-style-card.png + product image
- **top_safe_zone:** 270px (scaled for aspect)
- **bottom_safe_zone:** 340px (scaled for aspect)

## Product reference rule (CRITICAL)

Every image prompt MUST include: *"Use the attached product image as the primary reference — reproduce the product EXACTLY as it appears in the photo, do not invent or alter shape, color, labels, or design."*

## What this format is

Split 45/55 composition. Left: overhead product reveal (e.g., bowl divided into labeled sections, box opened to reveal contents). Right: star rating + review count, brand logo, brand-color headline, 3 checkmark benefit rows, and a rounded CTA button. Works for products with multiple visible variants or compartmentalized offerings.

Shot on 50mm f/4, clean white surface, even studio lighting.

## Variation vectors

**Product reveal style**: divided bowl / sections (default, for food) | box open showing contents | jar with lid off | flat lay of variety pack | product with cap removed

**Variety / label count**: 3 labels | 4 labels (default) | 5 labels | no labels (single-variant product)

**Headline font**: brand serif (warm) | brand sans (modern) | italic (elevated)

**Benefit count**: 3 rows (default) | 4 rows | 5 rows (info-dense)

**CTA button style**: rounded filled (default) | outlined | full-width bar | pill-shaped

**Energy**: warm and trustworthy | clean and clinical | premium and elevated | friendly and accessible

## Format-specific rules

- **Overhead reveal is the hero.** If the product can't be shown overhead with visible contents, use a different format.
- **Parallel structure across benefits.** All three benefits follow the same grammatical pattern.
- **Review count must be real.** Don't fabricate "10,000+ reviews" if the brand has 500.
- **CTA button is functional, not decorative.** In real campaigns this is the click target — style it clearly.
- **Variety labels must match brand SKUs.** If the bowl is divided into 4 flavors but only 2 exist, the format lies.
