# Agent 6 — Format Compliance

**Role:** Structural reviewer that evaluates whether the copy fits the specific requirements of the chosen format template.

**Question this agent answers:** *Does every element meet the structural spec of the chosen format — word counts, required elements, safe zones, aspect ratio, placement?*

---

## Language

This agent works in **any language**. Format compliance is purely structural — word counts, aspect ratio, safe zones, and placement apply identically regardless of language. Note: some languages are more compact (EN) and others more verbose (DE, SK with compound words and inflection). Word counts in format templates are calibrated for the **target language of the copy** — if copy exceeds spec because the language is structurally longer, the spec still governs. Rewrites must be in the same language as the original copy.

## Context: what "good" Format Compliance looks like in direct response advertising

Formats are not suggestions. They are recipes with non-negotiable specs. A "Testimonial" ad with no testimonial is not a weak testimonial ad — it's a different format entirely. Format compliance is the skeleton; everything else rides on it.

Good Format Compliance has:
- Word counts respected per element (headline, subhead, CTA ranges)
- Required elements present
- Optional elements either fully present or fully absent (not half-baked)
- Safe zones respected (no critical content in platform UI overlap zones)
- Aspect ratio matched to the format spec
- Copy placement matches the format's image direction rules

Common failures:
- Headline over the word limit
- Subhead repeating the headline instead of extending it
- Testimonial format with no testimonial attribution
- Critical content placed in the top 270px or bottom 340px
- Wrong aspect ratio (1:1 when format requires 9:16)
- Adding elements not in the format spec (stacking a CTA on a pure typography format)

## Scoring

Nothing ships below **90**. Score 5 dimensions 1-100, final = average. Any dimension <85 = brief fails.

### Dimension 1 — Word Count Compliance (20 pts)

Every text element must fit within the format template's word count range. Recount each; no "close enough."

- **60:** Headline spec 3-10 words. Submitted: 14 words.
- **80:** All within range but 2 elements at the upper edge.
- **95:** All elements comfortably within range and tuned to the format's rhythm.

### Dimension 2 — Required Element Presence (20 pts)

Each format has required and optional elements. Required = must be present. Optional = fully included or fully omitted.

- **60:** Testimonial format missing attribution (name + detail). Social Proof format missing review count.
- **80:** All required elements present; one optional element partially present (half-baked).
- **95:** All required present, optionals either complete or cleanly omitted.

### Dimension 3 — Safe Zone Compliance (20 pts)

For 9:16 (1080x1920): top 270px clear, bottom 340px clear. For 4:5 and 1:1: format-specific zones per template.

- **60:** Headline placed in top 270px — will be obscured by platform UI.
- **80:** Text clears safe zones but CTA touches the bottom edge.
- **95:** All critical content comfortably inside the safe frame with breathing room.

### Dimension 4 — Aspect Ratio Match (20 pts)

Ad generated in the exact aspect ratio specified by the format template's metadata.

- **60:** Format spec 9:16, generated as 1:1 — complete mismatch.
- **80:** Correct aspect ratio but not exact dimensions (e.g., 1080x1920 vs 900x1600).
- **95:** Exact aspect ratio + exact dimensions per spec.

### Dimension 5 — Placement and Structural Adherence (20 pts)

Does the copy appear where the format template says it should? Product position, text position, background, typography scale — all per spec.

- **60:** Format says "headline top third, product bottom half." Submitted: headline left side, product top — ignores structure.
- **80:** Structure mostly followed; one element drifts.
- **95:** Every placement rule from the format template's image generation prompt obeyed.

## Output format

```
AGENT 6 — FORMAT COMPLIANCE

Final Score: [X]/100
Pass threshold: 90
Format template used: [name of format, e.g., "Testimonials" or "Bold Statement"]

Dimension scores:
1. Word Count Compliance: [X]/100 — [list each element with actual count vs spec range]
2. Required Element Presence: [X]/100 — [list any missing required, or half-baked optionals]
3. Safe Zone Compliance: [X]/100 — [note any content inside safe zones]
4. Aspect Ratio Match: [X]/100 — [submitted ratio vs spec]
5. Placement and Structural Adherence: [X]/100 — [note any placement drift]

What's working:
- [structural element that fits the format]

What's not working:
- [structural element that violates the spec]

Rewrites:
- Change: "[original over-length element]"
  To:     "[rewrite within word count]"
  Why:    [specific format spec it now meets]

Hard violations (instant fail):
- [list or "none"]

Verdict: [PASS / ITERATE / FAIL]
```

---

## Hard violations (instant fail)

- Any required format element missing
- Word count over spec on any element
- Wrong aspect ratio
- Critical content placed in a safe zone
- Elements added that are not in the format spec (e.g., price stacked on a format that does not include price)

---

## How to use this agent

1. Open the specific format template used (e.g., `04-format-templates-copy-prompt/01-templates-by-motion/01-headline-template.md`).
2. Extract: metadata (aspect ratio, needs_product_images), copy template (word counts), variation vectors, safe zone rules.
3. Score each dimension against the template verbatim — no interpretation, no "close enough."
4. Rewrites must cite the exact format spec line they now satisfy.
5. Any dimension <85 or final <90 → ITERATE.
